<p>Artificial Intelligence is considered one of the branches of computer science, and one of the main pillars upon which the technology industry is based in the current era, and the term artificial intelligence - which is referred to by the acronym (AI) - can be defined as the ability of digital machines and computers to perform certain tasks that mimic They are similar to those of intelligent beings. Such as the ability to think or learn from previous experiences or other processes that require mental processes, as artificial intelligence aims to reach systems that enjoy intelligence and behave in the way that people behave in terms of learning and understanding, so that these systems provide to their users various services of education and guidance Interaction, etc.</p>
<p>Depending on its capabilities, artificial intelligence can be classified into three different types as follows: [6] Limited or narrow artificial intelligence: Weak AI or Narrow AI is one of the types of artificial intelligence that can perform tasks Specific and clear, such as self-driving cars, or even speech and image recognition programs, or chess on smart devices, this type of artificial intelligence is the most common and available today.</p>
<p>General AI: the type that can work with a capacity similar to the human ability in terms of thinking, as it focuses on making the machine capable of thinking and planning on its own in a similar way to human thinking, but there are no practical examples of This kind, for all that exists so far is merely research studies that need a lot of effort to develop and transform it into reality, and the method of artificial neural network (in English: Artificial Neural Network) is one of the methods of studying general artificial intelligence, as it is concerned with the production of a system of neural networks for the machine similar to that contained in it The human body. [7]</p>
<p>Super AI is the type that may exceed the level of human intelligence, which can do the tasks better than the specialized and knowledgeable man has, and this type has many characteristics that must be included in it. As the ability to learn, plan, automatic communication and make judgments, the concept of super artificial intelligence is considered a hypothetical concept that does not exist in our time.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence can also be classified according to the functions performed by it, as this classification includes four different types as follows: [6] Interactive machines: The artificial intelligence of interactive machines (in English: Reactive Machines) is the simplest type of artificial intelligence; As this type lacks the ability to learn from past experiences or past experiences to develop future business, it interacts with current experiences to produce them in the best possible way. Examples of this type of artificial intelligence are Deep Blue devices developed by IBM, and the AlphaGo system of the company Google.</p>
<p>Limited memory: The type of artificial intelligence with limited memory can store data of past experiences for a limited period of time, and the self-driving system is one of the best examples of this type; Where the last speed of other cars is stored, the amount of the vehicleâ€™s distance from other cars, the speed limit, and other data necessary to drive through the roads. Theory of Mind: This type of artificial intelligence is concerned with understanding the machine of human feelings, interacting with and communicating with people, and it is worth noting that there are currently no practical applications on this type of artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Self-awareness: the type of self-awareness (English: Self-Awareness) is one of the future expectations that the science of artificial intelligence aspires to, so that machines have self-awareness and special feelings, which will make them more intelligent than the human being, and this concept still does not exist on the ground Reality</p>
