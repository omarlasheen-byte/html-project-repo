<p>There are many tools available for learning artificial intelligence, including the following: [16] The Caffe Tool: This open source tool - that is, it is available for modification by anyone - was developed by Yangqin Jia as a research for his PhD thesis. At the University of California, this tool specializes in what is known as deep learning in artificial intelligence. Deeplearning4j: It is a deep learning programming library written in the Java language, and it is characterized by its ability to process big data, and like its predecessor, Deeplearning4j is an open source</p>
<p>IBM Watson tool: It is a tool that allows its users to answer their questions with capabilities similar to human capabilities, this tool may be a source of assistance in providing commercial advice and optimal decision-making, and it protects the data of its users through encryption, and it is worth noting that this tool is only available in the English language. Pybrain: a Python utility that helps beginners in Python, and for those who are interested in deep learning topics and artificial neural networks within artificial intelligence, this open source tool is a library of what is known as machine learning. .</p>
<p>Swift AI tool: This tool can work on Mac devices, and will soon be able to support the Linux system, as Swift AI allows its users to process signals, create deep learning algorithms, or even create neural networks in the field of artificial intelligence. Torch Tool: It is an open source tool for scientific computing within artificial intelligence, and this tool is characterized by its support for neural networks in artificial intelligence, its ability to perform linear algebra operations, and its support for the graphics processing unit</p>
